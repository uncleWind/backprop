backprop
========
backprop is a very raw Java (JDK 7) application which allows you to create simple neural network skeletons build around the backpropagation algorithm, made primarly for running and comparing results from Batch and Online training algorithms, with simple logging and network data storing in form of (outdated?) XML files.

It is authors' first bigger project being written solely by him, so the code may seem really messy. Pretty sure it is. Well, you gotta take first steps some day.
